# GT-4YR-Planner

#### GT-4YR-Planner is a dynamic four year planner for Georgia Tech Students.

#### In the backend, currently Python is utilized along with the Flask and Pandas. I have utilized Pandas/Regex to parse through all course data and set up the class configuration. I have a mongoDB database set up which contains all course data, which was exported to mongoDB from a csv file. 

#### I am currently working on configuring a user interface with React which coordinates with the backend through API calls.
