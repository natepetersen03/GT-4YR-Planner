# GT-4YR-Planner
GT-4YR-Planner is a full-stack web application that is currently in development, serving as a dynamic four year planner for Georgia Tech Students.
### Backend
In the backend, currently Python is utilized along with the RegEx/Pandas libraries. I have applied these to parse the all course data from GT and upload it into a csv file. I am using a local database to store all of the course data through MongoDB.
### Frontend
I am using Flask to aid in building the application and developing the frontend using React.js and AdobeXD.
