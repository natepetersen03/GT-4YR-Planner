# GT-4YR-Planner
GT-4YR-Planner is a dynamic four year planner for Georgia Tech Students.
In the backend, currently Python is utilized along with the RegEx/Pandas libraries. I have applied these to parse the all course data from GT and upload it into a csv file.
I am using a local database to store all of the course data through MongoDB, and developing the frontend using React.js and AdobeXD.
